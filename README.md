# generator-password

## My Task

This week's Challenge requires me to modify starter code to create an application that enables 
employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. 
This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. 
It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
